# Dynamic Web Application Deployment with Kubernetes on AWS EKS

## Introduction
This repository contains the configuration and deployment scripts for a dynamic web application hosted using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The application is designed to be highly available, scalable, and secure, utilizing a range of AWS services to achieve a robust cloud-native architecture.

## Architecture Overview
The application runs within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a multi-AZ setup for high availability. Traffic is routed through a Network Load Balancer to an EKS cluster, and data persistence is handled by Amazon RDS with master and standby instances across different subnets.

## Features
- High Availability across multiple AWS Availability Zones.
- Scalable Kubernetes pods managed by Amazon EKS.
- Secure data handling with Amazon RDS and read replicas.
- Centralized logging and monitoring.

## Prerequisites
- AWS CLI installed and configured.
- Docker for container management.
- Kubernetes command-line tool (`kubectl`) installed.
- EKSCTL for simplified EKS cluster creation.

## Getting Started
To get started with deploying this application, follow these steps:

### 1. Set up your AWS environment:
```sh
# Configure your AWS credentials
aws configure
```

### 2. Create the EKS cluster:
```sh
# Use EKSCTL or AWS Management Console to create an EKS cluster
eksctl create cluster --name <cluster-name> --version <k8s-version> --region <aws-region> --nodegroup-name <node-group-name> --nodes <number-of-nodes>
```

### 3. Deploy the application:
```sh
# Apply Kubernetes configurations
kubectl apply -f <k8s-deployment-file.yaml>
```

### 4. Access the application:
```sh
# Retrieve the Load Balancer URL
kubectl get svc
```
The application should now be accessible through the Load Balancer's DNS name.

## Configuration
The configuration directory contains YAML files for Kubernetes resources. Customize them according to your application's requirements.

You'll need to upload your architecture diagram to your GitHub repository and adjust the link in the README so that it points to the correct file location. Replace the `<placeholders>` with actual values, such as your cluster name, the number of nodes, the file paths, etc., and provide a valid contact email where people can reach you for more information.
